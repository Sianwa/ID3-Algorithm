# ID3-Algorithm
ICS 3A
GROUP : Lubuntu

We created a program that generates a decision tree based of attributes from a given data set.
The files containing the ID3 Algorithm are:
  1 id3.py
  2 fastGold.csv
  
Using the decision tree created we obtained the Intelligent Model Label(Prediction) and created a new program to generate
the confusion matrix,
The files containing the Confusion Matrix Algorithm are:
  1 confusion.py
  2. fastGold-IML.csv
  
We have also included screenshots of the expected output once the files are executed.
